A:: (main branch)
A:: I will write to top, if feature1 writes to bottom, then there should not be merge conflicts.

NOTE: Any line without A:: or B:: or C:: is written when all branches were merged!
This is File 1
I wrote stuff here.
My aim? To test git merge.
I think it is dangerous that I don't understand it yet.

B:: (feature1 branch)
B:: As you can see, I am adding content to the bottom!
